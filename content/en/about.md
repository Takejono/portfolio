Takeshi JONOO

Painter / Illustrator in Marseille.  

Graduated in Graphic Design in 1999 at Tama, Tokyo.  
After a 10-year career in the video game industry in Japan and France, I decided to become a freelance artist in 2015, and have resided at [Le Couvent](https://le-couvent.org) since May 2021.  

I work in a variety of styles, from illustration to painting, mainly in watercolor and Japanese ink, interspersed with pencil, oil pastel and pen.

Fascinated by watercolor and ink stains, I'm moving more and more towards the na√Øve world.  
I want to express the reality that oscillates between two opposites - immobility and movement, light and shadow, dream and reality, life and death, freedom and constraint, chance and necessity - gently enveloped in a poetic world where figuration and abstraction intertwine.

My research continues, in the hope that my work will inspire emotion and reflection.
