It's Takeshi. I love watercolor painting. I'm interested in childish, naive and poetic world more then more and I enjoy painting between figurative and abstract.<br>
Also, I know well digital painting as concept artist/Illustrator in video games development.<br>
Anyways, I hope always to create the visual who touch to the heat, and evoke the emotion.
